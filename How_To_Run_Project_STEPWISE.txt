Step 1: Open This Project/Folder In Your Installed IDE ('VS CODE' recommended)



Step 2: Also Open 2 Terminals In The Current Project
           -> If You Are In VS CODE   
                 - On The Top You Will See A Navigation Pane

                 - Automatically, A Terminal Will Be Opened Just At The Bottom Of Your IDE
                 - Repeat This Process To Open More Terminals



Step 3: Once You Opened All 2 Terminals, type these commands stepwise in the 2 terminals(one command in one terminal)
            -> cd server
            -> cd client
            
This will change the working directory in your project to admin, backend, frontend.



Step 4: In Each Terminal, Type This Command:

                Write there:  MONGODB_URL=<your_connection_string>
                        
                    Note Replace <your_connection_string> with your actual database connection URL that you pasted in MongoDB compass




Step 9: After the installation is complete, run these commands in their suitable directories/projects/folders in terminal:
            -> In server Project/folder:-> node index.js
